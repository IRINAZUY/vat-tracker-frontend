# Deploying to Vercel with Hash Routing

I've updated the application to use HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter to fix the dashboard loading issue. Here's how to deploy the updated code to Vercel:

## Steps to Deploy

1. **Commit your changes**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Switch to HashRouter for better compatibility with Vercel deployment"
   ```

2. **Push to your repository**

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

3. **Deploy to Vercel**

   If your repository is already connected to Vercel, it should automatically deploy the new changes. Otherwise, you can deploy manually from the Vercel dashboard.

## Vercel Configuration

Your current `vercel.json` configuration is already set up correctly for hash routing:

```json
{ "rewrites": [ { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" } ] }
```

This configuration ensures that all routes are directed to the index.html file, allowing the client-side router to handle the routing.

## Testing After Deployment

After deployment, test the following URLs to ensure they work correctly:

- Main site: `https://tracker.accessaccountinguae.com/`
- Dashboard: `https://tracker.accessaccountinguae.com/#/dashboard`
- Signup: `https://tracker.accessaccountinguae.com/#/signup`
- Add User: `https://tracker.accessaccountinguae.com/#/add-user`

Note that the hash (#) is now part of the URL, which is how HashRouter works.

## Why This Fixes the Issue

The issue was that the BrowserRouter was trying to use clean URLs without the hash, but this requires proper server-side configuration to redirect all routes to the index.html file. HashRouter uses the hash part of the URL which doesn't require server-side configuration, making it more compatible with static hosting services like Vercel.
